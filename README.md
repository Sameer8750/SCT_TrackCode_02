## Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.  🚢📈

## 📊 Dataset Overview : 
The Titanic dataset includes detailed information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status, personal attributes, and ticket details.

- Key Features of the Dataset:
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- Name: Passenger's name.
- Sex: Gender of the passenger.
- Age: Age of the passenger.
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
- Ticket: Ticket number.
- Fare: Passenger fare.
- Cabin: Cabin number.
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## 🔍 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for analysis, several cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed:

- Handling missing values in the 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns.
- Converting categorical variables such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical formats.
- Creating new features such as 'FamilySize' and 'IsAlone'.

## 💡 Insights

- The survival rate among passengers was approximately 38%.
- The majority of passengers were in the third class.
- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- Passengers with higher ticket classes had better survival chances.
- The age group 20-40 had the highest number of passengers.
